Phantomake is a static site generator with specific goals:

- Distributed as a single, standalone executable
- When run on an existing static site, will (in most cases) output the exact same site with no changes
- Can reuse common code (headers/footers/common HTML) across several pages with templates and includes
- Can do pagination (e.g. for blog listings)
