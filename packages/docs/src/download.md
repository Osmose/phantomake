### Binaries

You can download the latest binaries for your platform here:

- [MacOS](https://github.com/Osmose/phantomake/releases/latest/download/phantomake-macos.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://github.com/Osmose/phantomake/releases/latest/download/phantomake-linux.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://github.com/Osmose/phantomake/releases/latest/download/phantomake-windows.zip)

Phantomake does not currently have an update mechanism—you will need to redownload the binary to update to a newer version.

Older versions of Phantomake can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/Osmose/phantomake/releases) page on Github.

### Install via Bun

If you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed, you can also install Phantomake as a global package:

```sh
bun add -g https://github.com/Osmose/phantomake/releases/latest/download/source.tar.gz
```

This will add the `phantomake` command to your `PATH` and will run it on your local version of bun.

You can update to the latest version of Phantomake by re-running the command above after a new version is released.
